# DVDScribe
[DVDScribe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvdscribe), a very simple LightScribe application that allows you to burn images on your LightScribe discs. This application is based on the LightScribe public SDK.

This is a modern fork intended to run on newer 64-bit Windows versions (Windows 7/8/10 Professional).
