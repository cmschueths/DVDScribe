DVDScribe README.
-----------------

Hi, DVDScribe is just a simple and free LightScribe CD/DVD labeling application.
It is still in development and there will surely still be some bugs, so if you do find
any please report them at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=236661&atid=1100850
or email me at willem.mouton@gmail.com. Any suggenstions and ideas are welcome.

What you require to run DVDScribe.
----------------------------------
1.) Microsofts .Net2 runtime (Can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com)
2.) A LightScribe enabled CD/DVD drive
3.) The LightScribe Drivers (Please install them first ;-) )

Thats it.

Hope you have a lot of fun.
